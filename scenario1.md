   - **How:** Use lifecycle policies to move data to Glacier for cost-effective storage.
   - **Why:** Ensures data is recoverable in case of system failures or accidental deletions.

2. **Static Website Hosting**
   - **What:** Host static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - **When:** When you need to deploy a simple website without server-side processing.
   - **How:** Configure a bucket for static website hosting and use Route 53 for DNS.
   - **Why:** Provides a scalable, low-cost solution for serving static content.

3. **Data Sharing and Distribution**
   - **What:** Share large files with users or applications.
   - **When:** When you need to provide access to files or distribute content.
   - **How:** Generate presigned URLs for temporary access or set bucket policies for public access.
   - **Why:** Allows secure and controlled sharing of data.

4. **Big Data Analytics**
   - **What:** Store and analyze large datasets.
   - **When:** When dealing with big data or logs that need analysis.
   - **How:** Use AWS Glue to catalog data and Amazon Athena for querying.
   - **Why:** Provides a cost-effective storage solution with integrated analytics capabilities.

5. **Application Data Storage**
   - **What:** Store user-generated content, such as images, videos, and documents.
   - **When:** When developing applications that require user data storage.
   - **How:** Use S3 with object versioning to handle multiple revisions of user content.
   - **Why:** Provides durable and scalable storage for application data.

6. **Content Delivery**
   - **What:** Distribute static and dynamic content with low latency.
   - **When:** When you need to deliver content globally with minimal delay.
   - **How:** Integrate S3 with Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.
   - **Why:** Enhances performance and reduces latency by using edge locations.

7. **Disaster Recovery**
   - **What:** Ensure data is available across multiple geographic regions.
   - **When:** When implementing a disaster recovery plan.
   - **How:** Configure Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate data to different AWS regions.
   - **Why:** Provides high availability and resilience in case of regional failures.

8. **Compliance and Data Retention**
   - **What:** Store data in compliance with regulatory requirements.
   - **When:** When needing to retain data for specific periods as per compliance rules.
   - **How:** Use S3 Object Lock to prevent object deletion or modification for a set retention period.
   - **Why:** Ensures data integrity and meets legal and regulatory requirements.

9. **Log Storage and Analysis**
   - **What:** Store and manage logs generated by applications and services.
   - **When:** For monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting purposes.
   - **How:** Use S3 to collect logs and then analyze them with AWS services like Athena or QuickSight.
   - **Why:** Provides scalable storage for logs and integrates with analysis tools for insights.

10. **Development and Testing**
    - **What:** Store temporary data or application test files.
    - **When:** During the development phase of applications.
    - **How:** Use S3 to store test data or snapshots of development environments.
    - **Why:** Facilitates development and testing without incurring high storage costs.
